This calculator has been designed in stages:
1. The first PR was only the graphic part (UI).
2. In the second PR, MVP was implemented.
3.In the third Pr, the buttons were given functionality.
4. In the fourth pr, you could already perform basic operations.
5.In the current PR, the edge cases raised with my previous mentor have been corrected.
